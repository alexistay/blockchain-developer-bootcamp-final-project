# Ethereum Price NFT

## Concept
Most NFTs have value because they are supposedly scarce. However, most of this scarcity is artifically induced. For example, there are only 10,000 CryptoPunks, but there is nothing special about 10,000. The limit could have easily been set at 20,000, 50,000 or even 100,000.

I propose a NFT where there can only be 1 NFT per Ethereum price, and that NFT can only be minted when Ethereum is at that price. i.e. Say the current Eth price is $3000.23. If #3000 NFT has not been minted, then the user is allowed to mint the #3000 NFT. If #3000 NFT has already been minted, then it can no longer be minted again.

This produces real scarcity, as there can only be a certain number of this NFT, depending on the price of Ethereum. It would also be interesting to see how will the NFTs be valued. Will smaller number NFTs be more valuable than larger number NFTs because they were minted further in the past? Or will larger number NFTs be more valuable because the value of the eth (in USD) used to mint them is more than smaller number NFTs.


## Work Flow
1. User visits the webpage.
2. Webpage shows the current Ethereum price.
3. If an NFT for that price has not been minted before, the user is allowed to mint the NFT for that price.
4. Webpage also shows the current price, and a list of prices above and below the current price. For each price, it shows whether the NFT for that price has already been minted.
