# Ethereum Price NFT

## Concept
Most NFTs have value because they are supposedly scarce. However, most of this scarcity are artifically induced. For example, there are only 10,000 CryptoPunks, but there is nothing special about 10,000. The limit could have easily been set at 20,000, 50,000 or even 100,000.

I propose a NFT whereby there can only be 1 NFT per Ethereum price, and that NFT can only be minted when Ethereum is at that price. i.e. Say the current Eth price is $3000.23. If #3000 NFT has not been minted, then the user is allowed to mint the #3000 NFT. If #3000 NFT has already been minted, then it can no longer be minted again.


## Work Flow
1. User visits the webpage.
2. Webpage shows the current Ethereum price.
3. If an NFT for that price has not been minted before, the user is allowed to mint the NFT for that price.
4. Webpage also shows the current price, and a list of prices above and below the current price. For each price, it shows whether the NFT for that price has already been minted.
